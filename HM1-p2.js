//
//The questions:
//Declare a variable x and initialize it with an integer.
//
//How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer?
//
//Create a array called colors with the strings red, green and blue inside.
//
//How can you find the length of the string you just created?
//
//Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type. For example:
//
//let x = 9;
//let y = 'Hello';
//
//if () {
//  console.log('SAME TYPE');
//}
//If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?
//
//Write a program to answer the following questions:
//
//Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings?
//Can you compare inifities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 == 10/0? How can you test this?
